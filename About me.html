                Bio
            </h1>
            <p>
                I am a frontend developer who is passionate about transforming creative ideas into interactive,
                accessible, and visually appealing web experiences. I enjoy working at the intersection of design and
                technology where user experience meets clean, maintainable code.
                My journey into frontend development began with simple curiosity: how do websites come to life? <br>
                Over
                time, that curiosity grew into a passion for learning modern web technologies like CSS,
                and JavaScript. I love the satisfaction of seeing a layout come together or debugging a tricky issue
                until everything works perfectly.
                <br>
                Outside of coding, I am interested in UI/UX design, and I enjoy exploring tools like Figma to better
                understand how good design decisions translate into better user experiences.

                Goals in this program
            </h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Strengthen my foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by following best practices and writing
                    semantic, accessible code.
                </li>
               
                <li>
                    Improve my understanding of frontend frameworks like React, including component structure and state
                    management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Collaborate effectively with other developers, practice good Git/GitHub workflows, and write clear
                    commit messages.
                </li>
             
                <li>
                    Build confidence in presenting my work and explaining my technical decisions clearly to both
                    developers and non-technical audiences.

                Areas of low confidence
            </h1>
            <p>
                I am still working on building confidence in debugging complex JavaScript logic
                and managing state efficiently in React applications. <br> Sometimes, I also find it
                challenging to structure CSS for large projects in a scalable and maintainable way.

                Note to future self
            </h1>
            <p>
                Keep pushing forward, even when things get tough. Remember how far I have come
                from learning my first “Hello World” to building functional web applications. <br>
                Continue exploring new frameworks, stay curious, and never stop improving.

                Extra thoughts
            </h1>
            <p>
                I have realized that being a good developer is not just about writing code but about
                understanding people, solving problems, and creating experiences that make users' lives easier. <br>
                I am excited to keep growing, learning, and contributing to meaningful projects.
