      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a frontend developer passionate about transforming creative ideas into interactive,
        accessible, and visually appealing web experiences. I enjoy working at the intersection of design
        and technology, where user experience meets clean, maintainable code.<br><br>
        My journey into frontend development began with curiosity—how do websites come to life?
        Over time, that curiosity evolved into a deep passion for learning modern web technologies like
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love the satisfaction of seeing a layout come together or debugging
        a tricky issue until everything works perfectly.<br><br>
        Outside of coding, I am interested in UI/UX design and love exploring tools like Figma to understand
        how good design decisions translate into great user experiences.

    <!-- Areas of Low Confidence -->
    <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
      <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
      <p>
        I am still working on building confidence in debugging complex JavaScript logic and managing state efficiently
        in React applications. I also find it challenging at times to structure CSS for large projects in a scalable
        and maintainable way.

      <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
      <p>
        Keep pushing forward, even when things get tough. Remember how far you’ve come—from writing your first
        “Hello World” to building full-fledged web applications. Continue exploring new frameworks, stay curious,
        and never stop learning or improving.

    <!-- Extra Thoughts -->
    <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
      <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Being a great developer isn’t just about writing code—it’s about understanding people, solving problems,
        and creating experiences that make users’ lives easier. I’m excited to keep growing, learning, and
        contributing to meaningful projects that have real impact.
